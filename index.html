            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>My name is Emmit Kamakaniʻoluʻoluʻokoʻolau Kahaʻulelio Parubrub, but you can call me Emmit or Kamakani. 
            I was born on the island of Oahu, Hawaiʻi and raised in Kahaluʻu. I love being in the ocean, the mountains, 
            the basketball court, or the gym, but I have always been fascinated with technology. When I was a child my 
            environment was very rural and filled with nature so when I would see new technology I would be interested 
            and intrigued by how it worked. I've traveled to the Bay Area to pursue an education and career in technology 
            so I can fulfill my lifelong goal: help build the next big thing in technology that fosters that fascination 
            and passion that I used to have as a child into others.</p>

              <h2>Hawaiians in Technology</h2>
              <br>
              <h4>What is Hawaiians in Tech?</h4>
                <p>One of the projects I've been working towards is creating and establishing a community surrounded around Native Hawaiians 
                  in the technology industry. I've worked with another kanaka maoli to create this website and it's currently up on 
                  <a href="https://hawaiiansintech.org/">hawaiiansintech.org</a>. The goal of this community is to connect, inspire, provide 
                  representation, and promote the presence of Native Hawaiians who work in the technology industry. We're currently getting 
                  as many Native Hawaiians in the technology industry to join so please send this link to any that you may know.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Why?</h4>
                <p>I grew up as a mixed Native Hawaiian in Kahalu'u, Oahu and never felt as though I had anyone who represented my own cultural
                  background in Technology. As I've established a foundation in the Technology industry, I'd like to be the person that can 
                  offer support to those Native Hawaiians who are interested in entering the industry. I also want to be able to connect and create 
                  a community of Native Hawaiians who feel like they belong in this industry.</p>
