          <h1>Hello!</h1>
          <p>My name is Emmit Kamakaniʻoluʻoluʻokoʻolau Kahaʻulelio Parubrub, but you can call me Emmit or Kamakani. 
          I was born on the island of Oahu, Hawaiʻi and raised in Kahaluʻu. I love being in the ocean, the mountains, 
          the basketball court, or the gym but I have always been fascinated with technology. When I was a child my 
          environment was very rural and filled with nature so when I would see new technology I would be interested 
          and intrigued by how it worked. I've traveled to the Bay Area to pursue an education and career in technology 
          so I can fulfill my lifelong goal: help build the next big thing in technology that fosters that fascination 
          and passion that I used to have as a child into others.</p>
          <br><br><br>
          <p>Please feel free to keep reading more about my hobbies/interests below and click one of my socials below 
          to contact or keep up with my adventure.</p>
